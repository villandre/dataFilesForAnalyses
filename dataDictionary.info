## Data description

This data dictionary describes the contents of the following data objects:

* mainDataCompleteMap_May25_31_Larger.Rdata
* testDataMay28_May25_31_Larger.Rdata
* mainDataCompleteMap_May18_24.Rdata
* testDataMay21_May18_24.Rdata

The objects saved in the Rdata files are in the spacetime::STIDF format (an S4 format). The so-called "main" datasets (which are actually training datasets) differ from the test datasets only with respect to the inclusion of the "y" variable in the @data slot, which corresponds to the Land Surface Temperature (LST) values.

## Components

@sp@coords: A data.frame with two columns called 'x' and 'y', which gives the observation coordinates, expressed in the *sinusoidal* projection ("+proj=sinu +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +R=6371007.181 +units=m +no_defs") 

@time: Time values for observations in the 'xts'/'zoo' format (it is possible to get those values in 'POSIXct' format by using the 'time' function)

@data: A data.frame object with columns:

y: (Only included in the "main" (training) datasets) The LST readings derived from the MOD11A1 (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mod11a1v006/) and MYD11A1 (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/myd11a1v006/) data

landCover*: Dummy variables indicating the land cover value for each observation, obtained from the MCD12Q1 datasets (https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd12q1v006/); the suffix indicates the land cover index, and is based on the UMD land cover classification system, cf. table 4 in https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/documents/101/MCD12_User_Guide_V6.pdf; the reference category is 0 (water)

latitude: Measure of latitude, in the *sinusoidal projection*

elevation: Elevation, in meters, with respect to sea level, obtained from the ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model Version 3 (https://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/gdem.asp)

time*: Dummy variables for time, with the reference category being time = 1; in the main analysis (mainDataCompleteMap_May25_31_Larger.Rdata and testDataMay28_May25_31_Larger.Rdata), the data were collected between May 25 (time = 1) and May 31, 2012 (time = 7), and in the validation analysis (mainDataCompleteMap_May18_24.Rdata and testDataMay21_May18_24.Rdata), the data were collected between May 18 (time = 1) and May 24 (time = 7)

Aqua: Binary variable, with a 1 and a 0 indicating that an observation was collected by the Aqua and Terra satellite, respectively
